I worked at Sphere Studios for two years, during which I had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge massively multiplayer projects designed for the one-of-a-kind hardware used in the Sphere. Our goal was to overcome the unique technical and gameplay challenges that come with a venue that can hold an audience of thousands.

<ul>
<li>Engineered core gameplay in C++ using Unreal Engine 5, supporting experiences for 10,000 simultaneous networked players</li>
<li>Implemented dynamic gameplay driven by aggregated and individual player performance</li>
<li>Contributed to the exploration of multiple game genre prototypes (strategy, action, arcade, visual spectacle, gambling, etc.)</li>
<li>Collaborated with venue engineers to integrate audio and haptic responses to player actions</li>
<li>Tested experimental gameplay mechanics through rapid prototyping</li>
<li>Assisted in identifying and addressing areas of player confusion and rapidly iterated on feedback</li>
</ul>

<b>Other Roles</b>
<ul>
<li>Part of the Interactive department's Fun Committee</li>
<li>Sphere Tea Club ambassador and merch maker</li>
</ul>

    I cannot share images of our unreleased games. However, these are images that somewhat represent a two of our prototypes. The left was a space shooter game using the player's phone as a motion controller. The right was a collaborative world building game.
