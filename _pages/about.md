Hi! I'm <b>Jess Zhu</b>. I am a <b>game developer</b> with a B.S. in <b>Computer Science</b> with a focus in Games from the <b>University of Southern California</b>. I am passionate about making interactive experiences that engage with a wide audience.

I've worked with <b>MSG Sphere Entertainment</b> and <b>TogetherLabs</b> to create real time interactions using <b>Unreal Engine 5</b>. I especially enjoy working on the subtler elements, such as audio and haptics, to elevate the immersion. I frequently collaborate with designers and artists to bring their visions to life. 

I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what a game is, and captivate the public with innovative experiences.
